This file contains a list of gotchas that you should be aware of that will
affect your upgrade from one version of the WRE to another. Before upgrading
the WRE you should always read this file in the new version you wish to
upgrade to.


WRE 0.8.1

We made a change to the MySQL config so that it will index search terms as
small as two characters. Previously they had to be at least four. If you'd
like to retroactively apply this change to your site, you must reindex your
WebGUI sites with the search.pl utility that comes with WebGUI.



WRE 0.8.0

This version of the WRE is a complete rewrite of the WRE from the ground up.
All templates, file locations, APIs, etc have been changed in this release.
Therefore there is no direct upgrade path from previous WRE versions to WRE
0.8.0. A migration document has been created in the WebGUI community wiki. You
should follow the advice in that document to migrate your configurations from
a previous version of the WRE to this new version. Here's the URL:
