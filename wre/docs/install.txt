The instructions below should allow an experienced WRE admin to
get WRE up and running quickly. For more online instructions visit
http://wiki.webgui.org/


PRIOR TO INSTALLING

The WRE requires works best on a Linux-based operating system. We
recommend Red Hat Enterprise Linux, but it is not required. You
can also use the WRE on Mac OS X, BSD, and Windows based platforms.


INSTALLING

1. Unpack the archive.

	mkdir /data
	cd /data
	tar xvfz /path/to/wre-x.x.x-osname.tar.gz


2. Add a "webgui" user to the system. Note that you can name this 
user whatever you want, but we recommend "webgui". On most systems 
you run a command similar to the following as the root user:

	adduser -s /sbin/nologin webgui

		or

	useradd -s /sbin/nologin webgui

NOTE: If you're just using the WRE for development on your machine, feel
free to just use your own user account rather than creating a new one.


3. If you have an existing Apache or MySQL running please shut them
down now. On most systems you can shut them down hard by running
commands like this:

	killall mysqld
	killall httpd


4. If you have a MySQL config file at /etc/my.cnf please remove or
rename it so that it doesn't interfere with the WRE MySQL.

	mv /etc/my.cnf /etc/my.cnf.old


5. Create your DNS entries (or add to /etc/hosts) for the sites you
will be using, including the AWStats site.


6. Run the WRE Console which you can use to configure WebGUI.

	cd /data/wre/sbin
    . setenvironment.sh
    ./wreconsole.pl


7. Use your favorite web browser to visit the WRE Console setup page:

    http://localhost:60834/setup   

    http://www.example.com:60834/setup

NOTE: You may have to open a firewall port to access this.


8. Follow the on screen instructions to complete the configuration.


9. Go to the "Services" tab and start MySQL.


10. Go to the "Sites" tab and add your first web site.


11. Go to the "Services" tab and start mod_proxy, mod_perl, and S.P.E.C.T.R.E.


12. Visit your new web site!


13. Add the following cron jobs to your server's cron tab.

	0 0 * * * /data/wre/sbin/logrotate.pl
	*/3 * * * * /data/wre/sbin/wremonitor.pl
	0 2 * * * /data/wre/sbin/backup.pl

	If you are using the demo system then add this:

	0 0 * * * /data/wre/sbin/democleanup.pl




PLATFORM SPECIFIC NOTES
-----------------------

Red Hat Linux

This note applies to all linux' that use chkconfig to setup services. These
include RHEL, Fedora, Mandrake, SuSE, CentOS, and others. You can set up the
WRE to start automatically at system boot by running the following commands
after the WRE is installed:

ln -s /data/wre/sbin/services/redhat/rc.webgui /etc/init.d/webgui
chkconfig --add webgui
chkconfig webgui on


Mac OS X

There is no command line user add script on Mac OSX. This means you have to
use the really horrible netinfo interface to add a user. Instead, we recommend
downloading the user utilities from this site:
