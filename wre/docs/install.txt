The instructions below should allow an experienced WRE admin to
get WRE up and running quickly. For more online instructions visit
http://wiki.webgui.org/


PRIOR TO INSTALLING

The WRE works best on a Linux-based operating system. We recommend 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux, but it is not required. You can also use 
the WRE on Mac OS X, BSD, and Windows based platforms.


INSTALLING

1. Unpack the archive.

	mkdir /data
	cd /data
	tar xvfz /path/to/wre-x.x.x-osname.tar.gz


2. Add a "webgui" user to the system. Note that you can name this 
user whatever you want, but we recommend "webgui". On most systems 
you run a command similar to the following as the root user:

	adduser -s /sbin/nologin webgui
            - or -
	useradd -s /sbin/nologin webgui

    NOTE: If you're just using the WRE for development on your 
    machine, feel free to just use your own user account rather than 
    creating a new one.


3. If you have an existing Apache or MySQL running please shut them
down now. On most systems you can shut them down hard by running
commands like this:

	killall mysqld
	killall httpd


4. If you have a MySQL config file at /etc/my.cnf please remove or
rename it so that it doesn't interfere with the WRE MySQL.

	mv /etc/my.cnf /etc/my.cnf.old


5. Create your DNS entries (or add to /etc/hosts) for the sites you
will be using, including the AWStats site.


6. Run the WRE Console which you can use to configure WebGUI.

	cd /data/wre/sbin
    . setenvironment.sh
    ./wreconsole.pl

    NOTE: If you are not an administrator on this machine you should
    start the WRE console with sudo like thi:

    sudo ./wreconsole.pl

    NOTE: You should probably add the following command to your
    profile so it executes every time you log in:

    . /data/wre/sbin/setenvironment.sh


7. Use your favorite web browser to visit the WRE Console setup page:

    http://localhost:60834/setup   
            - or -
    http://www.example.com:60834/setup

    NOTE: You will need to open a port in your firewall to 60834 to 
    connect to WRE Console. Alternatively you can ssh to your WRE box
    like this:

        ssh -L60834:localhost:60834 root@www.example.com

    Then you will be able to access the WRE Console like this:

        http://localhost:60834/


8. Follow the on screen instructions to complete the configuration.

    NOTE: Safari is not capable of displaying a page as it's being downloaded
    so it is not the best browser you can use for the setup process, which is
    a realtime process. Safari will work in most cases, but it is not ideal.
    We recommend Firefox instead.


9. Go to the "Sites" tab and add your first web site.


10. Go to the "Services" tab and start mod_proxy, mod_perl, and S.P.E.C.T.R.E.


11. Visit your new web site!


12. Add the following cron jobs to your server's cron tab.

	0 0 * * * /data/wre/sbin/logrotate.pl
	*/3 * * * * /data/wre/sbin/wremonitor.pl
	0 2 * * * /data/wre/sbin/backup.pl

	If you are using the demo system then add this:

	0 0 * * * /data/wre/sbin/democleanup.pl




PLATFORM SPECIFIC NOTES
-----------------------

* Red Hat Linux

This note applies to all linux' that use chkconfig to setup services. These
include RHEL, Fedora, Mandrake, SuSE, CentOS, and others. You can set up the
WRE to start automatically at system boot by running the following commands
after the WRE is installed:

ln -s /data/wre/sbin/services/redhat/webgui /etc/init.d/webgui
chkconfig --add webgui
chkconfig webgui on

On RHEL 5 or higher you need to install the libgomp RPM.


* SELinux

The WRE contains no policies for configuring SELinux.  If you distribution
uses SELinux, you will need to disable it, set it into permissive mode,
or write your own policies for SELinux.


* Mac OS X

There is no command line user add script on Mac OSX. Therefore you can either
use the graphical "Accounts" manager in "System Preferences", or the really
horrible "netinfo" command line utility. Alternatively, you can also download
some free user utilities from this site:

http://www.osxgnu.org/software/pkgdetail.html?project_id=231#4095

To get the WRE to start automatically at boot run the following commands:

ln -s /data/wre/sbin/services/osx/org.webgui.wre.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/



* FreeBSD

You must install and use the bash shell while using the WRE. The WRE also
assumes that the bash shell is installed or linked at /bin/bash.

You can set up the WRE to start automatically at system boot by running the
following commands after the WRE is installed

 ln -s /data/wre/sbin/services/freebsd/webgui /usr/local/etc/rc.d/webgui
 echo "webgui_enable=YES" >> /etc/rc.conf.local
