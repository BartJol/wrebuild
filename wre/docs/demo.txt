So you want to run a WebGUI demo server. That's great news. There are a couple
of setup steps to go through to enable it.

1) Configure the database, by logging in as the administrative user and run
the following command:

    grant all privileges on *.* to demoadmin@localhost identified by
        'demoadmin' with grant option;

Feel free to change the password, but if you do, also edit the password in
your /data/wre/etc/wre.conf.


2) Change the owner of your /data/WebGUI/etc folder to be your web user. So if
you've created a user called "webgui" then the command on *nix environments
would be:

    chown webgui /data/WebGUI/etc

3) Optionally edit the demo/creation section of wre.conf.


4) Go into the WRE console and enable the demo. Do not attempt to do this from
the config file. It will fail.


That's it. You should now be ready to run your demo server.
